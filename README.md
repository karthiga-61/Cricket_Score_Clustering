# Cricket Score Clustering Using K-Means

This project demonstrates the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm to group cricket players based on their batting statistics, specifically their "Runs" and "Balls". The goal of this project is to use clustering techniques to categorize players into different groups based on their performance.

## Features:
- **Data Collection:** Cricket score data, including runs scored by players and the number of balls faced, is used as input for clustering.
- **K-Means Clustering:** The K-Means algorithm is applied to divide the players into clusters based on their scores.
- **Data Visualization:** The clustering results are visualized using scatter plots, allowing for a clear understanding of how players are grouped.
